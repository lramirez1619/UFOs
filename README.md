## Summary:
The webpage functions as intended. However, one drawback is the lack of visualization such as geographic maps, any type of charts, and any other visual tool that may help determine patterns or correlations.

It would be recommended to eliminate user entry to filter; potentially consider dropdown options.
Another recommendation would be able to select multiple states, cities, or by regions for a range of dates as opposed to one single date.
